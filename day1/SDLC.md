## SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

- **SDLC** is the structured process used to plan, design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems.

### 1. Waterfall Model

- Linear and sequential approach.
- Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- Suitable for projects with fixed requirements.
- Less flexibility for changes once a phase is completed.

### 2. Agile Model

- Iterative and incremental development.
- Requirements evolve through collaboration.
- Focuses on small, frequent releases.
- Better adaptation to change and continuous improvement.

## DevOps Framework

DevOps integrates development and operations to improve software delivery speed, quality, and reliability.

### 1. **Flow**

- Enables smooth movement of work from development to production.
- Focus on automation, reducing bottlenecks, faster delivery.

### 2. **Feedback**

- Fast, continuous feedback loops.
- Helps detect issues early and improve collaboration.

### 3. **Continuous Learning & Experimentation**

- Culture of constant improvement.
- Encourages learning from failures, experimenting, and enhancing processes.
